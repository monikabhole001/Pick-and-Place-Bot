# Pick and Place Bot

## Abstract
This Pick and Place Bot project involves a robotic system controlled by an Arduino microcontroller to automate the movement and manipulation of objects. It uses multiple DC motors and motor drivers to control the robot’s movement in different directions, as well as to control a gripper mechanism for grabbing and ejecting objects. The robot can move forward, backward, left, right, and also control the vertical motion of the gripper.

## Introduction
Pick and Place robots are widely used in industries for automating repetitive tasks that involve moving objects from one place to another. This project implements a simple robotic system using an Arduino and multiple motors to perform these tasks with commands received over serial communication.

## Hardware Components
- Arduino Uno (Microcontroller)
- 4 DC motors (for movement and gripper control)
- Motor driver circuits (to drive motors)
- Power supply for motors

## Software Description
The Arduino program controls four motors through digital output pins and PWM signals for speed control. It listens for commands via serial input and performs actions based on received characters:
- **F**: Move Forward (full speed)
- **A**: Move Forward (slow speed)
- **R**: Turn Right
- **L**: Turn Left
- **B**: Move Backward
- **G**: Grab (close gripper)
- **E**: Eject (open gripper)
- **U**: Move gripper Up
- **D**: Move gripper Down
- **S**: Stop all movements

## Code Summary
- Motor pins are defined for four motors controlling wheels and the gripper.
- Serial communication is used to receive commands.
- Based on command, motor pins are set HIGH/LOW and speed is controlled using AnalogWrite.
- Feedback messages are sent back via serial to confirm the action.

## Future Scope
- Adding sensors for object detection and precise positioning.
- Implementing wireless control using Bluetooth or Wi-Fi.
- Enhancing the gripper with force feedback.
- Integrating vision system for object recognition.
